# Handwritten-Digit-Generator
A real-time digit recognition system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and OpenCV. This Python application captures images from a webcam, processes them, and predicts the displayed digit. Includes scripts for training the model on custom digit datasets and real-time digit classification from live video feed
